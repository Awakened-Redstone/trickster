All tricks fit in the following categories:

- Delusion: no-input value-generating tricks
- Stratagem: tricks operating on a variable amount of inputs
- Distortion: fixed-input pure tricks
- Ploy: input-only and/or mana-consuming tricks
- Revision: scribing patterns

;;;;;

These categories are roughly followed, but in many cases, 
tricks will be sorted based more on intention than rigid definition.
