Macros allow you to create your own Revisions to aid with spell scribing. 
When drawing a pattern, maps inscribed into all worn [Rings](^trickster:items/ring) are checked for keys matching the drawn pattern

;;;;;

Macros take in the part of the spell that the pattern was drawn in as the first argument. 
The macro must then return a new spell. This spell replaces the circle the pattern was drawn in.
