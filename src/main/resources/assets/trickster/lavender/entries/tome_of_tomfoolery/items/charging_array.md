A Charging Array is a simple stone plate with nine slots for holding [Knots](^trickster:items/knots).
They can be placed in any orientation.
Exposing an array to the light of a full or new moon will charge any Knots it is holding, 
as if they were lying on the ground.

While they may look similar to a [Spell Construct](^trickster:items/spell_construct),
Charging Arrays are not able to cast spells or perform other magical interactions by themselves.
Their slots are however available for outside spells to interact with as they see fit.
