The Scroll and Quill can be used to easily write and store complex and reusable spells.


Right-clicking it opens the [Spell-Scribing](^trickster:editing) interface, letting you directly modify the contained spell.


Scrolls can be stored in a [Top Hat](^trickster:top_hat) for easy access and safe-keeping.

The written spell can be read from the scroll by means of [Notulist's Delusion](^trickster:basic_tricks).
It is also possible to write to a scroll programmatically using [Notulist's Ploy](^trickster:basic_tricks)
