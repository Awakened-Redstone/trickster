The following patterns regard basic arithmetic and simple mathematical operations.


Many base arithmetical operations, though not all, will work on both single numbers and vectors.

;;;;;

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:add,title=Summation|>

number... -> number | 

vec... -> vec

---

Adds up an arbitrary sequence of numbers into a single value.
Works with vectors.

;;;;;

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:subtract,title=Subtraction|>

number... -> number |

vec... -> vec

---

Sequentially subtracts an arbitrary sequence of numbers into a single value.
Works with vectors.

;;;;;

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:multiply,title=Multiplication|>

(number | vec)... -> (number | vec)

---

Multiplies many numbers into a single value.
A number and a vector combined will result in a vector.

;;;;;

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:divide,title=Subtraction|>

number... -> number |

vec... -> vec

---

Sequentially subtracts an arbitrary sequence of numbers into a single value.
Works with vectors.
