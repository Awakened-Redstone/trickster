Of a Nether Star, the Astral [Knot](^trickster:items/knots) is made. 
With a capacity multiple orders of magnitude greater than a Diamond Knot, 
the Astral Knot has a strange quirk: similarly to the Amethyst Knot, 
the moonlight does not replenish its stores. Instead, it replenishes itself.

;;;;;

The rate at which the Astral Knot fills is a small fraction of the amount it already contains. 
When empty, it does not replenish itself. As it approaches its capacity, its replenishment rate approaches 1kM.
