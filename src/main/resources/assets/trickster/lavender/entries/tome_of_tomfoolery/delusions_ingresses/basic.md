This chapter covers the delusion counterparts for two important tricks in the [Basic Ploys](trickster:ploys/basic) category.

;;;;;

<|page-title@lavender:book_components|title=Note: Reading from Scrolls|>The Notulist's tricks can both read and write 
from and to any spell-holding item. This means it's possible to read [Spell Fragments](^trickster:distortions/functions) 
directly from [Scrolls](^trickster:basics/scroll_and_quill), [Mirrors](^trickster:basics/mirror_of_evaluation), or [Top Hats](^trickster:basics/top_hat)

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:read_spell,title=Notulist's Delusion|>

-> spell | void

---

If the item in the caster's other hand contains an inscribed spell, returns the spell.
If not, returns void.

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:read_crow_mind,title=Crow Mind Delusion|>

-> any

---

Returns the value currently stored in the caster's [Crow Mind](^trickster:ploys/basic).
