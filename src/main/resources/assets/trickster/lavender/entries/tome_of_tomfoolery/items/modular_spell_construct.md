A Modular Spell Construct, unlike the simple [Spell Construct](^trickster:items/spell_construct), does not execute the spell inscribed onto it. 
Instead, up to four [Spell Cores](^trickster:items/spell_core) may be inserted into the construct's corner slots, where they will be executed concurrently. 
The Spell Cores draw mana from the [Knot](^trickster:items/knots) placed in the construct's center, and share the same [Crow Mind](^trickster:tricks/basic#7).
