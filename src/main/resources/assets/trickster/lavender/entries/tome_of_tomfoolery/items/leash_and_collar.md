*[...] and he accepted it graciously, his freedom a small price for the teachings of his Archmage.*

The Acolyte's Bindings and the Archmage's Tether serve a unique purpose: to allow someone to start a spell as someone else.

;;;;;

When the unlinked Bindings are worn and their wearer is crouching, the Tether may be used on them to bind the two together. 
Once bound, using the Tether with a spell inscribed will execute that spell as the wearer of the Bindings. 
The spell will take one of their spell slots, consume their mana, and be at their position. 
However, it will receive as its first argument the entity which made use of the Tether.
