The Top Hat is quite an ingenious piece of a caster's toolkit.
By equipping it on their head, a caster can press the <keybind;key.trickster.take_hat> 
button to hold the hat in their offhand.


When a Top Hat is held in your offhand, you can right-click to open the ui, and insert up to 27 scrolls.

;;;;;

These scrolls can be selected by scrolling while holding the Top Hat, which will cycle through them.


When a spell cast from your main hand tries to access the spell in your other hand via [Notulist's Delusion](^trickster:basic_tricks),
it will instead read the spell from the selected scroll in the held hat.

;;;;;

You can also access the spell in any slot of your Top Hat directly using [Cranium Ploy](^trickster:inventory),
or read the selected slot using [Cranium Delusion](^trickster:inventory).
