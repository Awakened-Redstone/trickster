- Removed event listening spell circles entirely. All placed circles now function purely as spell executors. (@enjarai)
- Significantly overhauled the Tome of Tomfoolery with new categories and better organisation. (@enjarai)
- Updated export string format to be more compact, the new version is incompatible with any exports from alpha 21. (@enjarai)
- Rebalanced the Conduit's Ploy by limiting the maximum tax ratio in vanilla to 1/20th of the used mana. (@enjarai)
  - Additionally made all golems mana-devoid by default.
- Pehkui compat has been removed. (@enjarai)
  - All scaling is now done using the vanilla scale attribute.
