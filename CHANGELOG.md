- Added the start of a tutorial to the Tome of Tomfoolery. (@enjarai)
- Allow inscribed spells to be transferred between items using a vanilla anvil. (@StellarWitch7)
  - Items may trigger their inscribed spell when certain actions are performed with them.
    - For example, a pickaxe will trigger its spell when mining a block.
  - This makes inscribed spells functionally similar to vanilla enchantments, though as yet more limited.
- Reworked revision internals. (@StellarWitch7)
- Broke spell import/export compatibility again, for the last time. (@enjarai)
- Added sine, cosine, and tangent patterns. (@enjarai)
