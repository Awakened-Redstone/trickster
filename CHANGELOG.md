- Redesigned the mana system significantly, making mana a semi-limited resource. (@enjarai and @StellarWitch7)
  - Players and entities no longer have mana pools.
  - Bloodcasting is no longer possible.
  - Instead, mana is contained in items called Knots.
    - These gemstones encased in glass orbs hold a certain amount of mana based on their rarity.
    - Some Knot types may have unique properties that manipulate mana in special ways.
    - Most Knots can be passively recharged under moonlight.
      - Knots charge most strongly under a new or full moon, but may not charge at all on some phases inbetween.
  - Mana over time is now measured in Merlins.
    - `Merlins = Gandalfs / Tick`
  - Many trick costs have been rebalanced to accommodate these changes.
  - Multiple tricks have also been added to automatically move mana around between knots.
- Introduced Spell Constructs. (@enjarai and @StellarWitch7)
  - These artificial spellcasting devices directly replace in-world spell circles, which have been removed.
  - Spell Constructs do not have an up-front mana cost, but must be crafted instead.
    - Once crafted, a spell can be inscribed onto the Construct.
    - When placed in the world, this spell will be cast persistently until completion.
    - If a mana source is required, a Knot may be inserted into the Construct.
- Also introduced Modular Spell Constructs. (@enjarai and @StellarWitch7)
  - These variations of the normal Construct contain four slots for Spell Cores.
    - Instead of casting a spell directly, Cores must be inserted containing the spells to be cast.
    - All inserted spells will be cast and run concurrently.
    - All cores share the same crowmind and mana pool from the provided knot.
    - Multiple tricks have been added to delegate to and manipulate other cores on the same Construct.
    - This allows for practical and persistent multithreaded spell design.
- Added Macros. (@Master-Bw3, @enjarai, and @StellarWitch7)
  - A list of Macros may be defined by inscribing a map of patterns to spells onto a common ring.
  - When wearing this ring, any pattern defined in the map can be drawn while spell-scribing to invoke the corresponding spell.
    - The given spell will be cast and given the circle the pattern was drawn in as an argument.
    - The spell may then construct a new circle using meta-programming to replace the given one.
  - A few changes were made to support this.
    - Any fragment can now be inscribed onto an item, not just spells.
    - Map fragments were added.
    - Pattern literals were added.
