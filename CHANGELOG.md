- Added Flecks, a way to display lines and other features in the world using spells. (@Vlue, @enjarai, @StellarWitch7)
  - This system will be expanded upon in the future.
- Added scroll shelves, a way to nicely display and store scrolls in your base. (@enjarai)

- Fix being able to die from mana overuse in creative mode. (@enjarai)
- Fix scrolling in the hat ui only working for offhand hats. (@enjarai)

  - Some behaviour is still inconsistent between vanilla and Sodium, but we plan to address this.
- Implemented a temporary solution for Surveyor (used by Antique Atlas) compat. (@enjarai)
- Added a keybind for modifying any spell on any item in creative mode. (@Awakened-Redstone)
