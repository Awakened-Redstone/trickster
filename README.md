Trickster is a magician-themed esolang-based magic mod loosely inspired by [Hex Casting](https://modrinth.com/mod/hex-casting).
It lets you draw infinitely nested spell circles and glyphs to combine tricks and create simple (or complex) magic.

## Functional as in Functional Programming

The spells you can scribe into scrolls are made in a turing-complete tree-like structure, 
offering complete freedom in creating the results you want.
Spells can do literally anything you can imagine*!

<sub>*Assumes your imagination is limited by the scope of available glyphs. 
Library inc. takes no responsibility for overactive imagination or other forms of undue creativity.</sub>

## Fully Documented

All glyphs and ways of spell-scribing are neatly documented in the Tome of Tomfoolery™, 
the go-to guide for being up to no good. Making use of the excellent [Lavender](https://modrinth.com/mod/lavender), 
the Tome™ provides a state-of-the-art guidebook experience for all of your magical needs.

## Magician's Tools

A magician is nothing without their box of tricks, or in this case, their hat!
The Top Hat can hold a bunch of spell scrolls and easily select any of them for quick access.

Aside from that, there are a bunch of other trinkets to use that can manipulate and use spells in different ways.
